The application provides a perfect environment for learning end-to-end testing with features including authentication, search, sorting, API integration, and more.

**Application Features:**

*   Movie browsing and search functionality
*   User authentication and profiles
*   Genre filtering and sorting
*   Movie details and recommendations
*   Responsive UI with modern React patterns
*   Real API integration for realistic testing

![Playwright Movies App](movies-app-ui-mode.jpg)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```

git clone   
cd playwright-movies-app  
npm install
```

### Environment Setup for Login Tests

To run login tests, create environment variables in a `.env` file. You can rename `.env.example` to `.env`, which contains the necessary variables.

**Note:** This app uses a mock backend, so any username and password will work for testing purposes.

### Running the Demo Application

**⚠️ Important:** The app must run on port 3000 as API calls are configured for this port. Using a different port will cause errors.

**Development Commands:**

```

# Start development server

npm run dev

# Production build and start

npm run build  
npm run start
```

**Verify Setup:**

1.  Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2.  Confirm the movies homepage loads
3.  Test basic navigation and search functionality
4.  Ensure login functionality works with any credentials

### Running Tests

**UI Mode (Recommended for Learning):**

```

npx playwright test --ui
```

This opens Playwright's UI mode where you can:

*   Walk through traces of each test
*   Debug test execution step-by-step
*   View screenshots and network activity
*   Understand test failures visually

**Alternative:** Use the [Playwright VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) for integrated testing within your editor.

### Application Architecture

**Built with:**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with React
*   **State Management:** Redux
*   **API Integration:** The Movie Database (TMDB)
*   **Styling:** CSS Modules and styled components
*   **Authentication:** Mock backend (any credentials work)

**Key Directories:**

```

movies-app/  
├── pages/ # Next.js pages and API routes  
├── components/ # Reusable UI components  
├── containers/ # Page-level containers  
├── services/ # API integration layer  
├── reducers/ # Redux state management  
└── public/ # Static assets
```

This application provides realistic complexity for learning comprehensive test automation patterns while remaining approachable for educational purposes.

## Prerequisites: Setting Up MCP Servers in GitHub Copilot

Before starting the hands-on modules, you must have Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers installed and integrated with GitHub Copilot. These servers provide specialized context and tools that power AI-assisted test generation.

### Required MCP Servers

You need three MCP servers configured in GitHub Copilot:

#### 1\. **Context7 (for documentation lookup)**

**Purpose:** Fetch real documentation for libraries and frameworks  
**Primary Use:** Understanding Playwright features and best practices

**Why It Matters:**  
When you ask "What's the Playwright's auto waiting feature all about?", Copilot uses Context7 to pull latest, accurate documentation instead of relying on stale knowledge.

**Validation Prompt:**

```

What's the Playwright's auto waiting feature all about? Use #mcp\_context7
```

**Expected Response:**  
Copilot returns:

*   Clear explanation of auto-waiting mechanism
*   Which methods auto-wait vs. don't
*   Timeout configurations
*   Best practices for waiting strategies

**Key Features Context7 Provides:**

*   ✅ Latest Playwright documentation
*   ✅ Best practice examples
*   ✅ API reference accuracy
*   ✅ Framework-specific guidance

#### 2\. **Playwright MCP (from Microsoft)**

**Purpose:** Execute Playwright commands and navigate applications  
**Primary Use:** Running codegen, executing tests, scanning UI

**Why It Matters:**  
Allows Copilot to actually interact with your app and generate production-ready tests.

**Capabilities:**

*   ✅ Run Playwright codegen on URLs
*   ✅ Navigate and scan pages
*   ✅ Record user interactions
*   ✅ Generate test code from walkthroughs

#### 3\. **GitHub MCP (for repository context)**

**Purpose:** Access your repository structure, files, and context  
**Primary Use:** Understanding codebase for test generation

**Why It Matters:**  
Copilot needs to read your actual code to understand:

*   File structure and organization
*   API route implementations
*   Page components and structure
*   Existing patterns and conventions

**Capabilities:**

*   ✅ List files and folder structure
*   ✅ Read source code of components/pages
*   ✅ Understand API implementations
*   ✅ Access test files and patterns

**Validation Check:**

```

Can Copilot read your project files and APIs?  
If yes → Server is configured correctly
```

### 4\. **Copilot instructions** generated at .github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md

Insert instructions that will be used with every call to copilot. 

Instructions

You are a Playwright test generator and an expert in TypeScript, frontend development, and Playwright end-to-end testing.

### **Test generation workflow**

*   You are given a scenario and need to generate a Playwright test for it.
*   If asked to generate or create a Playwright test, use the Playwright MCP server tools to navigate the site and generate tests based on the current state and site snapshots.
*   Do not generate tests based on assumptions. Use the Playwright MCP server to navigate and interact with sites.
*   Access the page snapshot before interacting with the page.
*   Only after all steps are completed, emit a Playwright TypeScript test that uses `@playwright/test` based on message history.
*   When you generate test code in the tests directory, ALWAYS follow Playwright best practices.
*   When the test is generated, always test and verify the code using `npx playwright test` and fix any issues.

### **Running the app**

*   If you're tasked with running, navigating, or testing the application, it's already running on `localhost:3000`. You do not need to start it.
*   When navigating, rely on the defined baseURL (`localhost:3000`). Do not include `localhost:3000` in URL assertions.

### **5\. Installation Checklist**

*   **Context7 installed** and available in Copilot (#mcp\_context7\_\* accessible)
*   **Playwright MCP installed** from Microsoft
*   **GitHub MCP configured** to access your repository
*   Copilot instructions generated at .github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md and formatted as list items
*   **Validation test passed** - ask Playwright question via Context7
*   **Terminal access** - can run `npx playwright` commands
*   **Write permissions** - can create files in tests/ directory

### Moving Forward

Once all three MCP servers are configured and validated:  
✅ You're ready to start Module 1  
✅ Each module leverages these MCP integrations  
✅ Context7 provides Playwright documentation (including auto-waiting) on demand  
✅ GitHub MCP enables codebase analysis  
✅ Playwright MCP allows interactive navigation and test generation

---

## Module 1: Why Manual Codegen Falls Short

### 1.1 The Manual Codegen Problem

The traditional workflow is slow and error-prone:

```

npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000/

# → Opens inspector and recorder

# → You must manually click every element

# → Copy-paste generated code (often incorrect)

# → Repeat for each test scenario

# Result: 2-3 hours per 5 tests
```

**Why It Fails:**

*   ❌ Manual clicking is tedious and error-prone
*   ❌ Generated code lacks business context
*   ❌ Selectors are brittle (based on DOM structure)
*   ❌ Tests are inconsistent (no pattern enforcement)
*   ❌ Doesn't scale (50+ tests = days of work)

### 1.2 The AI-Assisted Alternative

GitHub Copilot + MCP provides:

*   ✅ Context-aware test generation from prompts
*   ✅ Automatic pattern enforcement (test steps, POMs)
*   ✅ Self-healing tests (Copilot fixes failures)
*   ✅ Consistent structure across all tests
*   ✅ ~88% faster than manual codegen

---

## Module 2: Application Discovery with Copilot

### 2.1 Understanding Your Codebase

**Real Scenario:**  
You're new to a project and need to understand its structure before writing tests.

**The Prompt (from \_prompts.txt):**

```

I'm new to this project and I want to create end-to-end tests with Playwright.  
Can you please summarize possible pages and API routes and where they are defined?  
Don't share more information. Please write the result to #file:setup.md.
```

**What Copilot Does:**  
Scans your project structure and creates setup.md documenting:

*   All pages/routes with file paths
*   All API endpoints with methods
*   Framework and architecture
*   Key services and utilities

**Example Output (setup.md):**

```

# Application Structure

## Pages (Next.js file-based routing)

Pages live under movies-app/pages:

*   / → movies-app/pages/index.js (Home page)
*   /search → movies-app/pages/search/index.js (Search movies)
*   /movie → movies-app/pages/movie/index.js (Movie details)
*   /genre → movies-app/pages/genre/index.js (Genre browsing)
*   /my-lists → movies-app/pages/my-lists/index.js (User lists)

## API Routes

API endpoints served from next.js under /api:

*   GET /api/genres (returns all genres)
*   GET /api/movies/search (search movies by title)
*   GET /api/movies/discover (discover movies by filters)
*   GET /api/movies/:id (get single movie)
*   GET /api/people/:id (get person details)

## Architecture

Framework: Next.js with React/Redux  
Server proxy: movies-app/lib/tmdb.ts  
Client HTTP: movies-app/services/localAPI.js  
API routes: movies-app/pages/api/\*\*/\*.ts
```

**Why This Matters:**

*   ✅ Complete map of app before writing tests
*   ✅ Prevents testing non-existent features
*   ✅ Reference document for entire team
*   ✅ ~20 min to discover instead of manual hours

**Actionable Workflow:**

1.  Request Copilot to scan your codebase
2.  Copilot generates `setup.md` with structure
3.  Review and ensure completeness
4.  Use as reference for all future modules

---

### 2.2 Evaluation Criteria ✓

**Before moving to Module 3, verify setup.md includes:**

*   **Pages section** with routes and file paths (e.g., `/search → pages/search.js`)
*   **API section** with endpoints and HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
*   **Framework identified** (Next.js, Nuxt, React, etc.)
*   **Key files documented** (where pages, APIs, services live)
*   **No test scenarios yet** (discovery only, no test details)
*   **Concise format** (one-page reference, easy to scan)

**Red Flags ❌:**

*   Missing API endpoints or incomplete routes
*   File paths vague or missing
*   Includes test implementation details (too early)
*   Framework not clearly stated
*   Over 2-3 pages (should be scannable)

**Sign-Off Question:**  
_"Could a developer new to this project understand the structure from setup.md alone?"_  
If yes → Ready for Module 3. If no → Ask Copilot to clarify.

---

## Module 3: Test Planning from Application Analysis

### **3.1 Creating Your Comprehensive Test Plan**

**Real Scenario:** You've discovered the app structure. Now plan what to test—without writing code yet.

**The Prompt (from \_prompts.txt - adapted):**

```

Navigate to localhost 3000 using Playwright and scan the homepage and  
core functionality. Create an end-to-end testing plan with Playwright.  
Write the test plan to #file:testplan.md and include actionable test scenarios.  
Do not write any code yet; I just want an idea of what I could test.

Use the information in #file:setup.md. Categorize scenarios into clear sections  
and sub-sections. For each sub-section, include:

*   Objective (what is being tested)
*   Setup (prerequisites and initial configuration)
*   Test Steps (numbered, actionable steps for testers to follow)

For authentication use: user=me@outlook.com and password=12345
```

**What Copilot Does:**

*   Navigates your app UI
*   Observes user workflows
*   Creates test scenarios organized by feature
*   Writes them as: Objective → Setup → Test Steps

**Example Output (test-plan.md):**

```

# Movies Application - Comprehensive Test Plan

## Home & Navigation

### Header and Sidebar Navigation

**Objective:** Verify the header controls and sidebar navigation links  
are visible and route correctly.

**Setup:** Start the app at http://localhost:3000.

**Test Steps:**

1.  Click login or profile button.
2.  Enter email: me@outlook.com
3.  Enter password: 12345
4.  Click login button.
5.  Verify user is logged in (profile shown).  
    \`\`\`

**Why This Format:**

*   ✅ Non-technical stakeholders can review and approve
*   ✅ Clear business requirements (objective)
*   ✅ Prerequisites explicit (setup)
*   ✅ Step-by-step without implementation details
*   ✅ Ready for QA or automation engineer to implement

**Sections Typically Included:**

*   Home/Navigation
*   Search & Discovery
*   Feature Workflows
*   User Profile/Authentication
*   Error Handling
*   Edge Cases

### **3.2 Evaluation Criteria ✓**

**Before moving to Module 4, verify test-plan.md includes:**

*   **5-10 major scenarios** (not just 1-2)
*   **Main sections** organized by feature (Home, Search, Profile, etc.)
*   **Sub-sections** with clear names (e.g., "Header and Navigation")
*   **Objective stated** for each (what business requirement tested)
*   **Setup section** with prerequisites (starting state, dependencies)
*   **Numbered test steps** (5-10 per scenario, actionable)
*   **No code/selectors** (business language only)
*   **Each step is observable** (a human can execute it)
*   **Steps are specific** (not vague like "verify it works")

**Red Flags ❌:**

*   Only 1-2 major scenarios
*   Missing objectives or setup
*   Vague steps ("test the feature", "check results")
*   Technical language or selectors visible
*   Steps too granular (50 per scenario) or too broad (1 step per scenario)

**Sign-Off Question:**  
_"Could a non-technical QA person execute these steps and verify behavior?"_  
If yes → Ready for Module 4. If no → Ask Copilot to refine language.

---

## Module 4: Rapid Test Generation from Scenarios

### **4.1 From Test Plan to Working Code**

**Real Scenario:** Your test-plan.md is approved. Now generate actual Playwright tests using Copilot.

**The Prompt (from \_prompts.txt - adapted):**
```

Here's a playwright test case scenario:

```
[insert scenario from test-plan.md]
```

Execute the test plan using Playwright MCP. Once you’re done, please generate a Playwright test case in tests/workshop/search.spec.ts. The test case should include the above test case scenario as comments in test case.

\`\`\`\`

**What Copilot Does:**

*   Converts test plan steps into executable test code
*   Organizes with `test.describe()` blocks
*   Uses `test.step()` for readable reports
*   Includes scenario comments at top
*   Discovers likely selectors (may need adjustment)

**Generated Test Code Example:**

```typescript
// tests/workshop/search.spec.ts

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

/**
 * Test Plan Scenario:
 * 
 * ### Basic Movie Search
 * Objective: Verify users can search for movies by title and see results.
 * Setup: Start app at http://localhost:3000
 * Test Steps:
 * 1. Navigate to the search page or locate search input.
 * 2. Enter "Avengers" in the search box.
 * 3. Press Enter or click Search button.
 * 4. Verify results contain movies with "Avengers" in the title.
 * 5. Verify pagination controls appear if multiple pages exist.
 */

test.describe('Search & Discovery', () => {
  test.describe('Basic Movie Search', () => {
    
    test('should search for movies by title', async ({ page }) => {
      await test.step('Navigate to application', async () => {
        await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
      });
      ...
  });
});
```

**Key Patterns Used:**

1.  **Scenario comments** - original test plan preserved
2.  `**test.describe()**` - organize by feature
3.  `**test()**` - individual test case
4.  `**test.step()**` - labeled steps for reports
5.  **Auto-waiting** - `click()`, `fill()` wait automatically

**Running Tests:**

```
npx playwright test tests/workshop/search.spec.ts --reporter=html
npx playwright show-report
```

**HTML Report Shows:**

```
✅ Basic Movie Search (1523ms)
  ✅ Navigate to application (234ms)
  ✅ Enter search query "Avengers" (45ms)
  ✅ Submit search (789ms)
  ✅ Verify search results contain Avengers (123ms)
  ✅ Verify pagination exists (56ms)
```

### **4.2 Running and Fixing Tests**

**The Prompt (from \_prompts.txt):**

```
Run the generated playwright tests and if it fails fix it
```

**If test passes:**  
✅ Success → Move to Module 6

**If test fails:**  
Copilot analyzes the error and common causes:

| Error | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Timeout waiting for locator` | selector wrong or element hidden | Check selector/DOM or add explicit wait |
| `Target page/context closed` | action before navigation | Ensure `page.goto()` before interactions |
| `Element not visible` | covered by overlay or hidden | Check z-index, visibility, or use `force: true` |
| `No matching results` | pagination logic or empty data | Verify API returning data |

**Copilot's Repair Workflow:**

1.  Run test and capture error
2.  Analyze error message
3.  Suggest fix (often selector, wait, or navigation order)
4.  Apply fix and re-run
5.  Verify all tests pass

**Example Failure & Repair:**

```
❌ Expected: visible
Received: not visible

Timeout waiting for locator 'button:has-text("Search")'
```

Fix: Button might appear after content loads:

```typescript
// Before (failed)
await page.fill('input[placeholder="Search"]', 'Avengers');
await page.click('button:has-text("Search")');

// After (fixed)
await page.fill('input[placeholder="Search"]', 'Avengers');
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');  // Wait for UI to settle
await page.click('button:has-text("Search")');
```

### **4.3 Evaluation Criteria**

**Before moving to Module 5, verify:**

*   **Test file created** at `tests/workshop/search.spec.ts`
*   **Scenario comments** at the top from test-plan.md
*   `**test.describe()**` **blocks** match test plan sections
*   `**test.step()**` used for each logical step from plan
*   **All tests pass** (✅ Green checkmarks in report)
*   **HTML report readable** with clear step breakdown
*   **No extra manual waits** added (unless documented reason)

**Red Flags ❌:**

*   Test file doesn't exist
*   Scenario comments missing
*   Tests fail without investigation or fixes
*   Steps not grouped in `test.step()`
*   Force: true, or lots of hard-coded `wait()` calls

**Passing Check:**

```
npx playwright test tests/workshop/search.spec.ts --reporter=html
npx playwright show-report
```

Result: All tests show ✅, no ❌

---

## Module 5: Test Steps for Better Reporting

### **5.1 Using test.step() for Clarity**

**Real Problem:** Without organization, failing tests are hard to debug. You don't know which part failed.

**The Prompt (from \_prompts.txt - adapted):**

```
Use Playwright's test.step() method to group actions and give cleaner output 
for tests in #file:search.spec.ts
```

**What test.step() Does:**

```typescript
// ❌ Without test.step (fails—where? no idea)
test('search workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
  await page.fill('input', 'Avengers');
  await page.click('button');
  const results = await page.locator('.result').count();
  expect(results).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

// ✅ With test.step (clear debugging)
test('search workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  await test.step('Navigate to home', async () => {
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
  });
});
```

**HTML Report Difference:**

```
Without steps (confusing):
  ❌ search workflow (2456ms)
     Error: Timeout waiting for locator '.result'
     
With steps (clear):
  ❌ search workflow (2456ms)
    ✅ Navigate to home (234ms)
    ✅ Enter search query (45ms)
    ✅ Click search button (789ms)
    ❌ Verify results displayed (1388ms)
       Error: Timeout waiting for locator '.result'
```

**Benefits:**

*   ✅ Instantly see which step failed
*   ✅ Timing data per step
*   ✅ Self-documenting test flow
*   ✅ Better for reports and stakeholders

### **5.2 Refactor to Use test.step()**

**Current State:** Your `search.spec.ts` from Module 4 likely already has test.step() basics. Now refine it.

**The Task:**

```
Review search.spec.ts and ensure every logical action is wrapped in 
test.step() with clear, descriptive names. Group related assertions.
```

**Good Grouping Pattern:**

```typescript
test('complete movie discovery workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  
  // Step Group 1: Setup & Navigation
  await test.step('1. Navigate to application', async () => {
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
    await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Movies/i);
  });

});
```

**Grouping Strategy:**

*   **Setup & Navigation** - Load page, initial state
*   **User Actions** - Logically related interactions (search + click)
*   **Verification** - Related assertions grouped
*   **Follow-up** - Additional actions
*   **Final Verification** - Complete workflow assertions

**DON'T Over-Granularize:**

```typescript
// ❌ TOO GRANULAR (50+ steps per test—unreadable)
await test.step('Fill search box', async () => {
  await page.fill('input', 'Avengers');
});
await test.step('Press Tab', async () => {
  await page.press('input', 'Tab');
});
await test.step('Click button', async () => {
  await page.click('button');
});

// ✅ BALANCED (5-7 steps per test—clear)
await test.step('Search for Avengers', async () => {
  await page.fill('input', 'Avengers');
  await page.click('button');
});
```

### **5.3 Evaluation Criteria ✓**

**Before moving to Module 6, verify:**

*   **Every logical action** has a `test.step()` wrapper
*   **Step names descriptive** (not "Step 1", use "Navigate to search")
*   **Related actions grouped** (not separate step per click)
*   **5-10 steps per test** (not 50, not 1)
*   **Assertions in final step** of related group
*   **All tests still pass** (refactoring didn't break)
*   **HTML report readable** (steps make sense)

**Red Flags ❌:**

*   More than 20 steps per test
*   Vague step names ("Do thing", "Test")
*   Each `.click()` is its own step (too granular)
*   Assertions separate from related actions
*   Tests fail after refactoring

**Ideal Report:**

```
✅ Complete Movie Discovery Workflow (2345ms)
  ✅ 1. Navigate to application (234ms)
  ✅ 2. Search for "Avengers" (789ms)
  ✅ 3. Verify search results (123ms)
  ✅ 4. Filter by rating (456ms)
  ✅ 5. Verify filtered results (234ms)
```

## Module 6: Page Object Models (POMs) for Maintainability

### **6.1 The Refactoring Challenge**

**Real Scenario:**  
You have passing tests, but selectors are scattered and duplicated everywhere.

**The Prompt (from \_prompts.txt - adapted):**

```
"Please refactor the existing tests to use proper page object models 
located in 'tests/workshop/poms'. 

Don't change the existing functionality and don't create new tests."
```

**What POMs Do:**  
Centralize all selectors and page interactions so:

*   Selectors change in ONE file only
*   Tests stay clean (readable)
*   Business logic separate from UI details
*   Reusable across multiple tests

**Before POMs (Brittle, Fragile):**

```typescript
// tests/workshop/search.spec.ts

test('search for movie', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
  await page.fill('input[name="q"]', 'Avengers');
  await page.click('button[aria-label="Search"]');
  const results = await page.locator('.movie-grid > .movie-card');
  expect(await results.count()).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

test('filter by genre', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
  await page.click('select[name="genre"]');
  await page.click('text=Action');
  const results = await page.locator('.movie-grid > .movie-card');
  expect(await results.count()).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

// ⚠️ Problem: If selector changes, fix in TWO places!
```

**After POMs (Maintainable, DRY):**

```typescript
// tests/workshop/poms/HomePage.ts

import { Page, Locator } from '@playwright/test';

export class HomePage {
  readonly page: Page;
  readonly searchInput: Locator;
  readonly searchButton: Locator;
  readonly genreSelect: Locator;
  readonly movieCards: Locator;

  constructor(page: Page) {
    this.page = page;
    this.searchInput = page.locator('input[name="q"]');
    this.searchButton = page.locator('button[aria-label="Search"]');
    this.genreSelect = page.locator('select[name="genre"]');
    this.movieCards = page.locator('.movie-grid > .movie-card');
  }
  ...
}
```

**Benefits:**

*   ✅ Selectors in ONE place
*   ✅ Tests are easy to read
*   ✅ Business language in tests
*   ✅ Reusable across tests
*   ✅ Selector changes = 1 edit

---

### 6.2 Creating Page Object Models

**File Structure:**

```
tests/workshop/
├── poms/
│   ├── HomePage.ts           # Home page / search
│   ├── MovieDetailPage.ts    # Movie detail page
│   └── ProfilePage.ts        # User profile
├── search.spec.ts            # Tests using POMs
├── movie-detail.spec.ts
└── ...
```

---

### 6.3 POM Best Practices Review

**The Prompt:**

```
Check the page object models and tell me if they're using best practices. Use #context7 
```

**POMs SHOULD DO THIS:**

✅ **Locators as public readonly** - Tests can access `homePage.searchInput`  
✅ **Semantic methods** - `searchMovie()` not `click1thenFill2()`  
✅ **Return meaningful data** - `getMovieCount()` returns number  
✅ **Clear method names** - Business language, not `action1()`, `method2()`  
✅ **One responsibility** - HomePage only handles home page  
✅ **Constructor takes page** - `new HomePage(page)`  
✅ **NO assertions** - Tests do that, POMs don't

**Example of GOOD POM:**

```typescript
export class MoviesPage {
  readonly page: Page;
  readonly searchBox: Locator;
  readonly filterButton: Locator;
  readonly movieGrid: Locator;

  constructor(page: Page) {
    this.page = page;
    this.searchBox = page.locator('input.search');
    this.filterButton = page.locator('button.filter');
    this.movieGrid = page.locator('[data-testid="movie-grid"]');
  }

  async goto() {
    await this.page.goto('/movies');
  }

  async searchFor(title: string) {
    await this.searchBox.fill(title);
    await this.searchBox.press('Enter');
    await this.page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
  }

  async getMovieCount(): Promise<number> {
    return this.movieGrid.locator('[data-testid="movie-card"]').count();
  }
}
```

**Example of BAD POM (Don't Do This):**

```typescript
export class BadMoviesPage {
  // ❌ Assertions in POM
  async searchAndVerify(title: string) {
    await this.page.fill('input', title);
    expect(await this.page.locator('.result').count())
      .toBeGreaterThan(0); // ❌ NO ASSERTIONS IN POMs!
  }

  // ❌ Hard-coded test data
  async search() {
    await this.page.fill('input', 'Avengers'); // ❌ Test data!
  }

  // ❌ Complex business logic (belongs in test)
  async complexWorkflow() {
    // 50 lines of loops and conditions ❌ TOO COMPLEX!
  }

  // ❌ Overly specific brittle selectors
  readonly title = page.locator('div > span > p > em:nth-child(2) > strong');
}
```

### **6.4 Evaluation Criteria ✓**

**Before moving to Module 7, verify your POMs:**

*   **One POM per page** (HomePage.ts, SearchPage.ts, MovieDetailPage.ts)
*   **All selectors centralized** (no inline selectors in tests)
*   **No assertions in POMs** (only in test files)
*   **Clear method names** (searchMovie(), not search1())
*   **Semantic actions** (related interactions grouped: login = email+password+click)
*   **Return values useful** (getCount returns number, getText returns string)
*   **Tests updated to use POMs** (no inline locators)
*   **All tests still pass** after refactoring

**Refactoring Checklist:**

```
# Setup
- [ ] Created tests/workshop/poms/ directory
- [ ] Created POM files (HomePage.ts, etc.)
- [ ] Each POM has constructor(page: Page)
- [ ] POMs imported into test files

# Verify
npx playwright test tests/workshop/search.spec.ts --reporter=html

# Results
- [ ] All tests show ✅ (no ❌)
- [ ] Same number of passing tests before/after
- [ ] No new failures introduced
```

---

## Module 7: API Testing Automation

### **7.1 Understanding the API Layer**

**Real Scenario:**  
UI tests only verify the frontend. You need API tests to validate contracts independently.

**The Prompt (from \_prompts.txt - adapted):**

```
Using the API reference in setup.md, create a Playwright test in 
tests/workshop/api.spec.ts that validates the GET /api/movies/search 
endpoint by searching for a movie title and asserting the response status. 

Read the relevant API route source code to understand the expected behavior, 
run the test, verify it passes, and fix any failures automatically.
```

**API Testing vs. UI Testing:**

```typescript
// ✅ API Test (FAST, NO BROWSER)
test('GET /api/movies/search returns results', async ({ request }) => {
  const response = await request.get('/api/movies/search', {
    params: { query: 'Avengers' }
  });
  
  expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
  const body = await response.json();
  expect(body.results).toBeInstanceOf(Array);
  expect(body.results.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

// ❌ UI Test equivalent (SLOW, requires browser)
test('search returns results in UI', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.fill('input', 'Avengers');
  await page.click('button');
  await expect(page.locator('.result')).toBeVisible();
});
```

**Why API Testing Matters:**

*   ✅ 10-100x faster than UI tests
*   ✅ Tests API contract independently
*   ✅ Detects bugs earlier
*   ✅ Can test error cases easily
*   ✅ Better for load testing

### **7.2 Creating API Tests**

**Understanding the Endpoint (from setup.md):**

```
GET /api/movies/search

Query Parameters:
  - query (required): Search term
  - page (optional): Page number (default 1)

Response (200 OK):
{
  "page": 1,
  "results": [
    { "id": 550, "title": "Fight Club", "overview": "..." },
    ...
  ],
  "total_results": 150,
  "total_pages": 5
}

Error Responses:
  - 400: Missing required "query" parameter
  - 500: Internal server error
```

**Generated API Test:**

```typescript
// tests/workshop/api.spec.ts

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Movies API', () => {
  
  test.describe('GET /api/movies/search', () => {
    
    test('should search for movies by title', async ({ request }) => {
      await test.step('Send search request for "Avengers"', async () => {
        const response = await request.get('/api/movies/search', {
          params: { query: 'Avengers', page: 1 }
        });
        
        expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
      });
});
```

**Running API Tests:**

```
# Run all API tests
npx playwright test tests/workshop/api.spec.ts --reporter=html

# Run specific test
npx playwright test tests/workshop/api.spec.ts -g "should search for movies"
```

**Final Validation:**

```
# Run complete test suite
npx playwright test --reporter=html

# View results
npx playwright show-report
```

---

### 7.3 Evaluation Criteria ✓

**Before finalizing Module 7, verify:**

*   **api.spec.ts created** at correct path
*   **Search endpoint tested** with 3+ test cases
*   **Genres endpoint tested** with structure verification
*   **Error cases tested** (missing params, invalid requests)
*   **Pagination tested** (if supported)
*   **Response structure validated** (all properties present)
*   **Data types verified** (number, string, array checks)
*   **All tests pass** (run with HTML reporter)

**Test Command:**

```
npx playwright test tests/workshop/api.spec.ts --project=workshop --reporter=html
npx playwright show-report
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Passed: 5-7 tests ✅
Failed: 0 ❌
```

**Red Flags ❌:**

*   Tests depend on browser or UI
*   Hard-coded base URLs
*   No error case testing
*   Missing structure validation
*   Tests fail without investigation

## Module 8: Specialized Agents for Advanced Workflows

### 8.1 Introduction to GitHub Copilot Agents

GitHub Copilot supports specialized agents designed for specific workflows. For Playwright test automation, three agents provide targeted assistance:

**Available Agents:**

*   **🔧 playwright-healer** - Debugs and fixes failing tests
*   **📋 playwright-planner** - Creates comprehensive test plans
*   **⚡ playwright-generator** - Generates test code from plans

### 8.2 Using the Playwright Planner Agent

**When to Use:**

*   Starting a new testing project
*   Need comprehensive test coverage analysis
*   Want to document all possible test scenarios

**How to Activate:**  
Select the `playwright-planner` agent in GitHub Copilot, then use these prompts:

**Complete Application Analysis:**

```
@playwright-planner Navigate to localhost:3000 and create a comprehensive test plan for this web application. Include all user flows, edge cases, and error scenarios.
```

**Specific Feature Planning:**

```
@playwright-planner Create a detailed test plan for the [feature name] functionality. Focus on user workflows, validation scenarios, and edge cases.
```

**Test Coverage Review:**

```
@playwright-planner Review the existing test plan in [file] and identify any missing scenarios or test gaps for complete coverage.
```

**Agent Workflow:**

1.  Navigates application using Playwright tools
2.  Explores all interactive elements and user flows
3.  Maps primary and secondary user journeys
4.  Identifies edge cases and error conditions
5.  Creates structured test scenarios with clear steps
6.  Generates markdown documentation with implementation guidance

**Example Output Structure:**

```
# Application Test Plan

## Application Overview
- Feature summary and key functionality

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Core User Flows
#### 1.1 Happy Path Scenario
**File:** `tests/feature/happy-path.spec.ts`
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to application
2. Perform primary workflow
3. Verify expected outcomes

### 2. Edge Cases
#### 2.1 Error Handling
...
```

### 8.3 Using the Playwright Generator Agent

**When to Use:**

*   Have test plans ready for implementation
*   Need to convert manual test steps to automated code
*   Want consistent test structure and best practices

**How to Activate:**  
Select the `playwright-generator` agent in GitHub Copilot, then use these prompts:

**Generate from Test Plan:**

```
@playwright-generator Using this test plan: [test plan section], generate a complete Playwright test file with proper test structure and best practices.
```

**Convert Manual Steps:**

```
@playwright-generator Convert these manual test steps into automated Playwright code:
1. [step 1]
2. [step 2]
3. [step 3]
```

**Generate Test Suite:**

```
@playwright-generator Generate a complete test suite for [feature] based on the test scenarios in [plan file]. Create separate test files for each major scenario.
```

**Agent Workflow:**

1.  Analyzes provided test plan or manual steps
2.  Sets up browser page and navigation
3.  Executes each step manually to understand interactions
4.  Generates complete test source code with:
    *   Proper file naming and organization
    *   Test descriptions matching scenarios
    *   Step comments for clarity
    *   Best practice implementations
5.  Places tests in appropriate describe blocks

**Example Generation:**

```typescript
// spec: test-plan.md
// seed: tests/seed.spec.ts

test.describe('User Authentication', () => {
  test('Valid Login Flow', async ({ page }) => {
    // 1. Navigate to login page
    await page.goto('/login');
    
    // 2. Enter valid credentials
    await page.fill('[data-testid="email"]', 'user@example.com');
    await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', 'password123');
    
    // 3. Click login button
    await page.click('[data-testid="login-button"]');
    
    // 4. Verify successful login
    await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="user-menu"]')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### 8.4 Using the Playwright Healer Agent

**When to Use:**

*   Tests are failing with unclear error messages
*   Need systematic debugging of multiple test failures
*   Want to apply best practices while fixing issues

**How to Activate:**  
Select the `playwright-healer` agent in GitHub Copilot, then use these prompts:

**Initial Assessment Prompt:**

```
@playwright-healer I have failing Playwright tests. Please analyze the current test failures and create a systematic plan to fix them.
```

**Specific Failure Prompt:**

```
@playwright-healer This test is failing: [test name]. The error message is: [error message]. Please investigate, diagnose the root cause, and fix the test.
```

**Batch Fixing Prompt:**

```
@playwright-healer Run all tests, identify the failures, and fix them systematically one by one until the entire test suite passes.
```

**Agent Workflow:**

1.  Executes failing tests to gather error information
2.  Analyzes error messages and stack traces
3.  Investigates selectors, timing, and application state
4.  Applies fixes using Playwright best practices
5.  Re-runs tests to verify fixes
6.  Continues until all tests pass

**Example Interaction:**

```
User: @playwright-healer Fix the failing search tests

Agent Response:
✅ Identified 3 failing tests in search.spec.ts
✅ Root cause: Search input hidden until form is clicked
✅ Applied fix: Added form.click() before input interaction
✅ All search tests now pass
```

### 8.5 Agent Workflow Integration

**Recommended Agent Sequence:**

**Planning Phase** - `@playwright-planner`

**Implementation Phase** - `@playwright-generator`

**Maintenance Phase** - `@playwright-healer`

**Continuous Workflow:**

```
Plan → Generate → Test → Heal → Repeat
```

### 8.6 Best Practices for Agent Usage

**✅ Do This:**

*   Be specific in your prompts
*   Provide context about the application
*   Use agents for their specialized purposes
*   Review generated code for business logic accuracy
*   Combine agents for comprehensive workflows

**❌ Avoid This:**

*   Using agents for tasks outside their expertise
*   Vague prompts without context
*   Skipping the planning phase
*   Ignoring agent recommendations
*   Not validating generated code

### 8.7 Integration with Previous Modules

**Enhanced Workflow with Agents:**

*   📍 Module 2: Discovery → Use `@playwright-planner` for application analysis
*   📍 Module 3: Planning → `@playwright-planner` creates comprehensive test plans
*   📍 Module 4: Generation → `@playwright-generator` converts plans to code
*   📍 Module 5-7: Implementation → Manual refinement with Copilot
*   📍 Module 8: Maintenance → `@playwright-healer` fixes failures

**Time Savings with Agents:**

*   **Planning**: 30 min → 10 min (with `@playwright-planner`)
*   **Code Generation**: 2 hours → 30 min (with `@playwright-generator`)
*   **Debugging**: 1 hour → 15 min (with `@playwright-healer`)
